A fun game to learn sign language for all ages.

Game Instructions:
A video of a word's representation in sign language appears on the side of the screen, words (displayed as text) fall from the top of the screen.
The player must catch the falling word shown in the video.
If you catch the right word, you earn 100 points and an extra life point.
If you catch a wrong word you lose 10 points and lose a life.
If you did not catch a single word and the words ended up, you lose a life point.
The more stages you go through, the faster the game - meaning way more challenging.
Enjoy!
